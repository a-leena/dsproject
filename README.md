## End-to-End Data Science Project
* Developed a fully modular machine learning project pipeline following industry standards.
* Used Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Streamlit to predict student math scores based on reading/writing performance and categorical features.
* Implemented best practices such as:
  * Custom exception and logging systems
  * setup.py for package-like project structure
  * Configurable data pipeline and model training modules
* Created a lightweight Streamlit web app to demonstrate predictions interactively.
* Practiced Git-based version control and project documentation.
